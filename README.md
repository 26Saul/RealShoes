## About The Project

RealShoes simulates the front page of an online shoe store, including a hero section, product cards, navigation, footer with social links, and a contact section with an embedded map.  
The goal of the project is to practice React component structure, routing with `react-router-dom`, and integration of external libraries such as React Leaflet for maps. [file:5][web:81]

## Main Page Description

The main page presents a hero section highlighting the RealShoes brand and its key value proposition (quality footwear with a modern look).  
Below the hero, users can scroll through featured products, see prices and short descriptions, and navigate to other sections such as contact or legal pages.  
The footer includes social media icons, links to the GitHub repository, the Figma design, and quick navigation back to the home page. [file:5]
